\title{Create a line graph given the original, unweighted graph. In a line graph,
edges are nodes, and edges connected by a node are edges.}
\usage{
CreateLineGraph(predictionsByEdge, graphWithPredictions, edgeTypeList)
}
\arguments{
\item{predictionsByEdge}{Prediction levels corresponding to each edge.}

\item{graphWithPredictions}{Original graph data frame.}

\item{edgeTypeList}{List containing one or more of the following:
- "shared.outcome.analyte"
- "shared.independent.analyte"
- "analyte.chain"}
