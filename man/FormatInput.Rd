\title{Format the input for graph-based learning. This input consists of:
1. The Laplacian of a line graph built from the co-regulation graphs, where 
each node corresponds to a pair of analytes.
2. A prediction value for each node of the line graph, for each sample X.
3. The true prediction values Y for each sample X.}
\usage{
FormatInput(
  predictionGraphs,
  coregulationGraph,
  inputData,
  stype.class,
  edgeTypeList,
  stype,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{predictionGraphs}{A list of igraph objects, each of which includes
predictions for each edge.}

\item{coregulationGraph}{An igraph object containing the coregulation graph.}

\item{inputData}{MultiDataSet object (output of ReadData()) with gene expression,
metabolite abundances, and associated meta-data}

\item{stype.class}{The class of the outcome ("numeric" or "categorical")}

\item{edgeTypeList}{List containing one or more of the following to include
in the line graph:
- "shared.outcome.analyte"
- "shared.independent.analyte"
- "analyte.chain"}

\item{stype}{The phenotype or outcome of interest}

\item{verbose}{Whether to print the number of predictions replaced in each sample.
TRUE or FALSE. Default is FALSE.}
