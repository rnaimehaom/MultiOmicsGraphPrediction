\usage{
PlotGraphPredictionsAllFolds(
  graphs,
  inputDataFolds,
  saveInDir = NULL,
  vertices = NULL,
  truncateTo = 4
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graphs}{The graph with predictions projected onto it.}

\item{inputDataFolds}{List of named lists (output of 
CreateCrossValidationFolds()) with gene expression, metabolite abundances, 
and associated meta-data}

\item{saveInDir}{Directory where file should be saved. If NULL, then the output
is plotted without being saved. Default is NULL.}

\item{vertices}{List of vectors of vertices to plot. This is used if one
wishes to focus on a subset of vertices. If NULL, then all vertices are plotted.
Default is NULL.}

\item{truncateTo}{Vertex names are truncated to the first "truncateTo" characters.
Default is 4. If NULL, names are not truncated.}
