\arguments{
\item{predictions}{Prediction data frame, where rows are samples, and
columns are predictors.}

\item{inputData}{The input data read in using the function IntLIM function
ReadData.}

\item{lowerPercentileLimit}{Sample-specific percentile below which outliers
will be removed.}

\item{upperPercentileLimit}{Sample-specific percentile above which outliers
will be removed.}

\item{metricList}{A list of the valid metrics to include. Valid metrics are
"pdf", "localerr", "globalerr", and "pathway".}

\item{k}{The number of nearest neighbors to consider in localerr.}

\item{eigStep}{The number of eigenvectors to step by during the evaluation
in localerr.
Note that this must be less than the number of samples in localerr. Default = 10.}

\item{alphaMin}{The lowest value of alpha to investigate in localerr. Default = 0.}

\item{alphaMax}{The highest value of alpha to investigate in localerr. Default = 1.}

\item{alphaStep}{The value of alpha to step by during the evaluation in localerr.
Default = 0.1.}

\item{analytehaspathway}{A mapping from analytes to pathways. This
mapping has two columns: RaMPID and PathID. Used in pathway importance.}

\item{analyteNamesOut}{A data frame mapping the analyte identifier for the
outcome analyte from the IntLIM model to an identifier that can be mapped
to RaMP. Used in pathway importance.}

\item{analyteNamesInd}{A data frame mapping the analyte identifier for the
independent variable analyte from the IntLIM model to an identifier that can be mapped
to RaMP. Used in pathway importance.}

\item{source}{A data frame that maps analyte identifiers to RaMP internal
identifiers.}
}
\value{
A list of data frames (one for each sample) with predictor importance
measured according to the listed criteria (one column per metric, one row
per predictor).
