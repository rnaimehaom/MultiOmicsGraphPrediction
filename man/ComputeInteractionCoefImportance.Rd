\title{Compute the importance using absolute value of interaction term coefficient. Specifically,
the coefficient percentile is calculated and taken as the weight.}
\usage{
ComputeInteractionCoefImportance(predictions, modelStats)
}
\arguments{
\item{predictions}{Prediction data frame, where rows are samples, and
columns are predictors.}

\item{modelStats}{A data frame that includes the interaction p-values and
interaction coefficients for each pair (such as the one output by IntLIM's
ProcessResults function)}
}
\value{
A data frame with the importance metric for each sample and each
predictor. The metric will be the same for all samples in this case.
}
\description{
