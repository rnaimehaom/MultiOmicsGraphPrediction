\title{Optimize the combination of predictors by metafeatures alone (in other words,
exclude pooling and combine in a single layer using a linear combination).}
\usage{
OptimizeMetaFeatureCombo(
  modelResults,
  verbose = TRUE,
  pruningMethod = "odds.ratio",
  binCount = 10,
  margin = 0.1,
  includeVarianceTest = FALSE,
  modelRetention = "stringent"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{modelResults}{An object of the ModelResults class.}

\item{verbose}{Whether to print results as you run the model.}

\item{pruningMethod}{Set to "information.gain", "odds.ratio", or "error.t.test"}

\item{binCount}{The number of bins to divide your original data into. Default is 10.
Used in information gain pruning only.}

\item{margin}{The margin of error for a prediction to be considered "correct".
Default is 0.1. Used in odds ratio pruning only.}

\item{includeVarianceTest}{Scale the t-score by the f-statistic (the ratio of variances).
Only applicable when the pruning method is error.t.test. Default is FALSE.}

\item{modelRetention}{Strategy for model retention. "stringent" (the default)
retains only models that improve the prediction score. "lenient" also retains models that
neither improve nor reduce the prediction score.}
}
