\title{Plot the line graph for each sample with nodes colored according to prediction.
Include a color scale for the predictions.}
\usage{
PlotLineGraph(
  modelInput,
  stype,
  saveInDir = NULL,
  truncateTo = 2,
  titleStart = NULL,
  weights = NULL,
  analytes = NULL,
  includeLabels = TRUE,

  vertexSize = 10
)
}
\arguments{
\item{modelInput}{A list of ModelInput objects.}

\item{stype}{Outcome / phenotype}

\item{saveInDir}{Directory where file should be saved. If NULL, then the output
is plotted without being saved. Default is NULL.}

\item{truncateTo}{Analyte names are truncated to the first "truncateTo" characters.
Default is 4. If NULL, names are not truncated.}

\item{weights}{The weight assigned to each node. This is encoded using opacity.
If NULL, all nodes are opaque. Default is NULL.}

\item{analytes}{analytes of interest. Default is NULL}

\item{includeLabels}{whether or not to include labels. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{cutoffs}{Cutoff weight values, which can be included for visibility.
Default is NULL.}

\item{vertexSize}{Vertex size to use in display.}
}
